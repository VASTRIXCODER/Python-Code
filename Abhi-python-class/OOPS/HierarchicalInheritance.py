'''
One parent class will have more than one child classes, or  more than one child will hae same direct parent class - Hierarchal Inheritance


One parent class will have one child that will act as a parent class for subsequent child class - Multi level Inheritance


One child class that possesses a parent class - Single Level Inheritance


Through child class object reference variable (rObj), we can access non-overriden members of parent class P, and all of R class members as well.

Super() function is used to access parent class specific overriden functions from child class specific functions. (This occurs in all inheritances!)
